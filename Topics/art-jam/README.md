## Description

This description should help the reader understand what the program is, anything they should know to be able to experience it (controls, special features, etc.), and what the desired user experience is.

> "Me, I and Myself" is an interactive self-portrait that allows feed the main character (Me) a cookie using the mouse.

> The whole interaction is controlled by the mouse shaped as a cookie. The closer the cookie is of the mouth, the bigger the mouth becomes to eat it. When the cookie is finally in the mouth, it will disapear with left click.

>There's a small detail too, if the cookie gets closer to the bee, this one will open her mouth too
