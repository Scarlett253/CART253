# Planning tictactoe (xula and frijol)

## Starting point

The initial idea:
Tic tac toe (with a twist?)

## Experience design

The experience:

> The user uses the mouse + left CLICK or the 4 arrows + ENTER to place X or O against their rivals; can be another user or the computer itself (thats more difficult...). 

## Breaking it down

Basic things to do:

- 
- 
- 
- 

Questions:

- What does the horse looks like?
    - rectangles! (pixel art)
- How does the user control the horse?
    - User controls horse with the space bar 
- How does the objects appear?
    - The objects start appearing on the right moving to the left at the bottom of the page, they appear in loop
- What happens if the user hits an obstacle?
    - game over (like in the google's dinosaur game)
- What does it all look like on the screen? Layout?
    - Like google's dinosaur game

## The program starts to form....

What is there?

- The horse
    - Position and size
    - velocity
- The obstacles
    - Position and the size
    - Velocity
    - infinity loop

```
horse
    body
        x
        y
        size
        speed
    

obstacles
    x
    y
    size
    
```

What happens in this project?

- Start (setup)
    - Create a canvas
    
- Every frame (draw)
    - Draw the background
    - Move and draw the horse 
        - Add the horse's speed to it x
        - Draw a rectangle at the horse's position with its size (brown)/or make it an image
    -draw the obstacles
        - Move the objects on loop, x position
        - Draw squares as obstacles


Events

- If the user press the space bar, the horse jumps
- If the horse hits an obstacle is a game over

FEATURES to do:
- Menu (and instructions) change to game after space bar is pressed
- Isaac dancing Song plays after starting the game 
- add sound effects when the horse jumps
- Score/time system
- An ending: You can win or you can lose



* Deploying the full set of programming skills covered in the course, including arrays, loops, and data-structures.

* Understanding how a basic underlying experience can be made distinctive through different programming approaches

* Creating a more polished work that could be part of a portfolio
