During studio time, I got to try almost all my classmates Mod Jams, including Amélie's, Aydan's and Amanda's. Honestly each of their works was really different but really cool on its own way.

Amélie's project really caught my attention right away. The visuals are literally "cute", clean and responsive, and I love how even small movements with the mouse could cause big changes on the screen. Looking at her code I could see it was really organized, everything was separated nicely, which made it easy to read.

Aydan's project felt totally different. More chaotic and playful. The visuals were such a masterpiece on my opinion; pretty creative. I t was like the simulation had its own personality, reacting in weird ways. I realized he did a lot of trial and error while checking his code in GitHub where I felt related with.

Amanda's project was the opposite of Aydan's and Amélie's, much more minimal and quiet, but engaging. The aesthetic was pretty warm and I love the fact she again used her dog in this project. Her code was simple and clean, pretty similar to the frogfrogfrog simulation opposite to Amelie's and Aydan's as I said before. I was also focused on timing and small interactions. I feel that the fact it was really minimalist makes it be more enjoyable and it push the user to continue playing.

Overall, I think what stood out the most across all three projects was how differently they handled the user interaction and expirience. I learned a lot by seeing their codes and I might used them as examples in future projects.
