Art-Jam response

For this project i got to explore the artwork of my classmates Amélie Barrette, Amanda Stormyr and Arielle Wong. It was pretty interesting how each of them approached their projects so differently and unique. Some of them were more focused on the visuals while others on the coding and interactivity, each of the pieces had its own personality even though we're all used similar codes seen in class.

 Amélie's work scares me a little bit but the color palette helps too chill me out. I like how i can inmediatly identify the codes she used because they are the same we saw in class but she adapt em to make something fun on her self portrait, like the "Mr. Furious" exercise, the code for shaking on the mouth and the code for making the day become night. I also really like what she did with the mouse, adding her cat randomly. The only thing I don't feel attract to is the choice of song when you press the mouth, but still pretty cool how she coded that.  

Doggy Doggy!

 I can't stop laughing after had interact with Amanda's Art Jam. At the beginning was a little bit creepy with the animated eye that follows the cursor, the background noises and the distortionate voice. But I gotta say, she did a pretty fun and yet simple way to interact with the work. I love that it is a mini game of two choices with an hilarious ending. I think the fact that is a picture and she made it move is just so interesting and creative and the whole vibe makes it look like a 2000 grunge web site, just lovely!

Ari and Soup

I love every single pixel of Arielle's artwork: the color palette, her drawing syle, and the small interactions. The noise that the bowl of soup makes when is picked up by the mouse is so satisfactory, like asmr, and I find it interesting that when you wanna put it back, there'S a silhouette that lets you know where was it at the beginning. The interaction of the soup and the glasses is so smart and relatable for people who wear glasses, including me, it's an actual funny image to relate with. The style actually reminds me a lot to the old Cartoon Network, animation styles like "Dexter's Laboratory", "Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends" or even "The Powerpuff Girls". To be honest, I can already picture it as a videogame I would have on my phone. 

Seeing these three projects together made me realize how powerfulncreative coding can be. Even though we're all using similar tools , everyone's project felt unique. Amélie's piece was playful and creepy, Amanda's was chaotic and funny, and Arielle's was warm and nostalgic. Each one has it's own mood and personality exactly as "in my perspective" is the way it was suppose to be, showing how coding can go beyond technique to become something creative and personal.
