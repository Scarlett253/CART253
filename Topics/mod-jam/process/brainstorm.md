#Mod Jam ideas

1. Frog can change of color (why does it changes of color? does it changes of color because it cathces a fly? does it changes of color because it has free will?)

2. Frog can do crazy moves randomly (because of its free will again? maybe because it's happy for catching a fly, or maybe because it's not catching anything at all; it's mad crazy)

3. Frog change of position (FREE WILL??? does it helps it for catching the flies easier?)

4. Frog has different levels(levels as it becomes more difficult to catch flies after every catch)

5. Frog is the fly (Freaky Friday?? Is this to create emphaty for such insignificants beings, or just to be silly?)

6. Frog can talk (is the frog polite? or is it gonna start cussing for not being able to catch any flies? Fr, why is it that difficult to catch flies?)

7. Fly can talk (haha, the fly is insulting the frog, or is it asking for help because it's gonna be eaten by a terrible green monster?)

8. Background changes of color (from day to nigth? or because the frog is catching flies inside a disco club? That would be cool)

9. Add more beetles (Yessss, it's 2025, we want diversity, let's add some ladybugs, I love ladybugs, or some bees, there's a lot of bees around campus nowdays. Does the other beetles increment the powers of the frog? or are they weaknesses??)

10. Beetles have different mods (As I was saying, maybe the ladybugs are extra points depending how many spots they have, what abt the bees?they hurt the frog with their stings, and there'S bumblebees too, those ones are just cuties patooties)

11. The frog is not a frog anymore (it's another reptile? another mammal? a fungus? a plant? Maybe at the beginning of the game you get to choose what do you wanna be)

12. The frog is a human now( Does this human has clothes? or is a wild human being who's been living in the wild since baby? or, is the frog acting as human?)

13. The frog is now one of those animals that eats ants (and the flies are ants now)

14. The frog shoots the fly(The frog has a rifle now, it's tired of trying to catch the flies, now it's hunting em cold blood)

15. The fly shoots the frog(What? they switch papers, the fly hunts the frog now. Is the fly defending itself? does the fly has a licence for carrying a gun?)

16. The frog and the fly combat a mutual enemy; a human (That's right, after all this time they realized they both have so many similar tastes, they both love listening to Dua Lipa. How does this work? is the fly riding the frog? or is next to it? is it in the left or in the right of the frog?)

17. The frog is now a square (why a square? is it always a square or it's a mod? Like, does it becomes a square because he eat a fly or because it hasn't catch one yet? is the fly a square too? is this the minimalist mode?)

18. The fly is now a pie (I mean, of course the frog is tired of eating flies, ew, now it's a pie lover. Does the pies have different flavours? different colours? different shapes?)

19. The frog has wings now (Is the frog gonna be able to fly around or it just has wings in its back? are they pixie wings? angel wings? fly wings?)

20. The fly eats the frog now (It is not the same ide as idea 5, The fly is still flying above the frog, but now is the frog that moves like crazy from side to side.)
