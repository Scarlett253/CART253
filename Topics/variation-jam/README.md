## Description
> "COOKIE EATER" is a simulation about a monster who tries to eat the mouse at all costs. The user's mission is that as a cookie, it has to collect as many chips as it can and not die in the process. It also includes other two variations: the Dog Variation and the Cat Variation. The idea is the same but with different variations of cookies and treats.

> Before starting the simulation there's a menu screen that includes the title, the instructions, the three different variations and the procedure to start playing. To start the simulation you press one of the three keys it shows: "N" is for the Monster Variation (the normal one), "D" is for the Dog Variation and "C" is for the Cat Variation. Then the screen state changes to one of the variations playing state and each of them has it's own random song playing on loop.

> The Monster simulation (Normal Variation) includes a pink background that smoothly changes of shades to make the game look more attractive and playful. A blue fluffy monster starts aggresively following the mouse in a medium speed, trying to eat the cookie all around the screen no matter what. The chips of the cookie randomly appear all over the screen. After collecting them, this ones are added on the cookie in a random position. For the score, the points are added on the cookie as chips and also as numbers on the top right of the screen. It only has one ending: a Game Over, where you get eaten by the monster. The game over screen shows a close up of the monster's face: there's it's two eyes that keep following the mouse with their pupils and a mouth that keeps getting bigger or smaller depending in the distance of the mouse. There's a text saying " ##GAME OVER## " in the middle top of the screen and then it gives you the option to go back to the main menu by pressing "ESC".

> The second simulation (Dog Variation) includes a blue background that smoothly changes of shades to make the game look more attractive and playful. The head of my dog Xula starts aggresively following the mouse in a normal speed opening and closing her mouth like PacMan, trying to eat the dog cookie all around the screen no matter what. There's small bones randomly appearing all over the screen. After collecting them, this ones are added to the score on the top right of the screen, and then they appear again in a random position. It only has one ending: a Game Over, where you get eaten by Xula. The game over screen shows another blue background that smoothly changes of shades to make the visuals more interesting. It also includes a rotating yellow star in the center with Xula's head continuing opening and closing her mouth. In each of the sides are dog cookies also rotating in the same rythm of the star. There's a text saying " ^^XULA ATE YOU^^ " in the middle top of the screen and then it gives you the option to go back to the main menu by pressing "ESC".

> The third simulation (Cat Variation) includes a yellow background that smoothly changes of shades to make the game look more attractive and playful. The head of my boyfriend's cat Frijol starts aggresively following the mouse in a maximum speed (almost impossible to escape) opening and closing her mouth like PacMan, trying to eat the fish cookie all around the screen no matter what. There's small fishes randomly appearing all over the screen. After collecting them, this ones are added to the score on the top right of the screen, and then they appear again in a random position. It only has one ending: a Game Over, where you get eaten by Frijol. The game over screen shows another purple background that smoothly changes of shades to make the visuals more interesting. It also includes a rotating yellow star in the center with a gif of a cat chewing a treat. In each of the sides are Frijol heads continuing opening and closing their mouths till the end of the times.There's a text saying " ** FRIJOL COOKED YOU ** " in the middle top of the screen and then it gives you the option to go back to the main menu by pressing "ESC"

> The simulation is controlled by the mouse. You can move all over and around the screen, and the cookie eaters will follow you and try to catch you. Each of them have different levels of speed: Xula is the slowest, the Monster goes average speed and Frijol is the fastest (cuz is a cat, duh). The scoring system depends on how many treats you collect which bug the player catches. If the player catches a fly the score increases +1 point, but if it misses, the player gets a strike; it takes 3 strikes for a game over. If the player catches a ladybug, it eliminates one strike, but the score dicrease -1 point. For winning, the player needs a score of 30.
