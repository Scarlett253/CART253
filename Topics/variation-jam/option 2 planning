# Planning Cookie Monster 

## Starting point

The initial idea:

> A monster that tries to eat the mouse.

## Experience design

The experience:

> The user controls the mouse all around the screen trying to avoid the monster, otherwise they'll get  eaten (or worse...). The way of escape for the mouse is entering doors (simple black squares) that takes the user to different rooms (//This idea was removed). If the mouse is reach by the monster, it gets eaten and lose the game.

## Breaking it down

Basic things to do:

- Draw the monster (image? a circle?)
- draw the mouse (like make it have another shape? a cookie?)
- Make the monster move (in line? around? random? INPREDICTABLE??)
- What happens if the mouse it's eaten? (the screen explotes? jumpscare? obviously game over...or not?...)

Questions:

- What does the monster looks like?
    - A circle, a fluffy circle like the cookie monster, a mouth and two eyes .
- How does the user control the mouse?
    - IT's literally the mouse lol
    - does the mouse does any other action? left click? right click?
- Levels? //This idea was removed
    - yesss yes yes!
    - Add like secret paths?
    - Change of rooms by entering doors?
    - Hidding?

- How does the user wins? // It cannot afford
    - Again, levels?
    - score? //Collect treats
- What does it all look like on the screen? Layout?
    - that last game on ready player one? the scene with the easter egg? //This idea was only 5% used


## The program starts to form....
